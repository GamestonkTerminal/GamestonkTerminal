[green]Competition Risk[/green] ([3mApple's stock has been downgraded to Hold by Loop Capital due to the company reducing its builds and shipment forecasts for the second time in the last four weeks. Loop's Supply Chain Analyst John Donovan sees Apple having reduced its June quarter builds and shipments by around 10%, which is incremental to the lowered June quarter guidance the iPhone maker provided on May 4. The analyst sees material downside risk to June quarter revenue (both iPhone & overall) relative to both Apple's guidance and Street after this weekend. Despite the overall risks, the analyst believes stronger than appreciated iPhone ASPs can counterbalance softening units. - Benzinga (https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/23/05/32512771/iphones-or-ifrowns-analyst-predicts-dwindling-shipments-despite-potent-iphone-asps)[0m)


[green]Technology Risk[/green] ([3mApple is expected to launch its mixed-reality headset shortly, potentially as early as the beginning of June, during its annual worldwide developer conference (WWDC). The headset would be Appleâ€™s first all-new product line since the Apple Watch and the potential launch comes at a time when Appleâ€™s smartphone and computing product businesses face a slowdown, with Covid-19 tailwinds easing. However, the new device is not expected to significantly impact Apple's stock in the near term due to its high price tag and niche target audience. - Trefis (https://www.trefis.com/articles/549163/dont-count-on-apples-new-headset-to-move-the-needle-for-the-stock/2023-05-22)[0m)
