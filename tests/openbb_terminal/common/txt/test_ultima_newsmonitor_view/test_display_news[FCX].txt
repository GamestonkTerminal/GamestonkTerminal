[green]Regulatory Risk[/green] ([3mIndonesia will allow exports of copper, iron ore, lead, zinc, and anode mud from copper concentrates to continue despite a planned export ban in June, as many smelters were delayed by the pandemic. The country's Energy and Mineral Resources Minister, Arifin Tasrif, stated that banning these materials prematurely would cost the country revenue and jobs. Copper miners Freeport Indonesia and Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara will be exempt from the ban due to smelter development delays caused by the pandemic. This decision may impact FCX's operations in Indonesia and its supply chain. - Zawya (https://www.zawya.com/en/world/china-and-asia-pacific/indonesia-to-allow-exports-of-five-raw-minerals-despite-june-ban-w16a5k93)[0m)
