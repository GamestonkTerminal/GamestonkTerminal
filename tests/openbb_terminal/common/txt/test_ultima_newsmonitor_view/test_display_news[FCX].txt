[green]Regulatory Risk[/green] ([3mIndonesian President Joko Widodo is betting on a halt on exports of raw minerals next month to draw investment and create more jobs and economic development. This policy change could impact Freeport-McMoRan's operations in the country, as it has significant investments in Indonesia, particularly in its PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI) subsidiary. The Indonesian government is currently negotiating with FCX to extend its permit beyond 2041 and has reportedly asked to increase its stake in PT-FI from 51% to 61% as part of the negotiation process. - Nikkei Asia (https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Asia-Insight/Indonesia-bets-on-critical-mineral-export-bans-as-deadline-nears)[0m)


[green]Financial Risk[/green] ([3mFreeport-McMoRan's stock price has experienced a steep pullback since its peak in January 2023, falling more than 25% towards its recent May lows. This decline has been attributed to weak economic data from China, including poor industrial and consumer spending data, as well as a slowdown in the property market recovery. Additionally, the copper inventory stockpile has been building up, causing further concern for investors. Despite these near-term challenges, Freeport CEO Richard Adkerson remains confident about the long-term prospects of the copper industry and the company's focus on copper investments. - Seeking Alpha (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4606446-freeport-mcmoran-the-pain-may-end-soon)[0m)
