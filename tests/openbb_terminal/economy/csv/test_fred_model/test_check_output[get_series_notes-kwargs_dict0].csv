Many series include both seasonally adjusted (SA) and not seasonally adjusted (NSA) data.
Occasionally, updates to the data will not include sufficient seasonal factors to trigger a seasonal
adjustment. In these cases, the NSA series will be updated normally; but the SA series will also be
updated with the NSA data. The NSA series can be located here here
(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU48191005552000001).  Some seasonally adjusted series may
exhibit negative values because they are created from a seasonal adjustment process regardless of
the actual meaning or interpretation of the given indicator."

previously calculated this seasonally adjusted (SA) series based on the not seasonally adjusted
(NSA) version available here (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU72000005552000030). However,
most of the earnings-related series do not have a significant seasonal component, so the values for
both the SA and the NSA series are very similar. See the NSA series
(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU72000005552000030) for updated values.  The Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis used to seasonally adjust this series by using the 'statsmodels' library from
Python with default parameter settings. The package uses the U.S. Bureau of the Census X-13ARIMA-
SEATS Seasonal Adjustment Program. More information on the 'statsmodels' X-13ARIMA-SEATS package can
be found here
(https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.x13.x13_arima_analysis.html). More
information on X-13ARIMA-SEATS can be found here (https://www.census.gov/data/software/x13as.html).
Many series include both seasonally adjusted (SA) and not seasonally adjusted (NSA) data.
Occasionally, updates to the data will not include sufficient seasonal factors to trigger a seasonal
adjustment. In these cases, the NSA series will be updated normally; but the SA series will also be
updated with the NSA data. The NSA series can be located here here
(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU72000005552000030).  Some seasonally adjusted series may
exhibit negative values because they are created from a seasonal adjustment process regardless of
the actual meaning or interpretation of the given indicator."

Many series include both seasonally adjusted (SA) and not seasonally adjusted (NSA) data.
Occasionally, updates to the data will not include sufficient seasonal factors to trigger a seasonal

updated with the NSA data. The NSA series can be located here here
(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU40000005552000001).  Some seasonally adjusted series may
exhibit negative values because they are created from a seasonal adjustment process regardless of
