Many series include both seasonally adjusted (SA) and not seasonally adjusted (NSA) data. Occasionally, updates to the data will not include sufficient seasonal factors to trigger a seasonal adjustment. In these cases, the NSA series will be updated normally; but the SA series will also be updated with the NSA data. The NSA series can be located here here (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU36935615552000001).

Some seasonally adjusted series may exhibit negative values because they are created from a seasonal adjustment process regardless of the actual meaning or interpretation of the given indicator.""

New York City, NY constitutes a significant percentage of the state's total statewide employment. This series is calculated in addition to the New York-Wayne-White Plains, NY-NJ (MD)'s statistics because of it's importance to the state.

Nationality refers to the ultimate obligor, as opposed to the immediate borrower on a residence basis, and is linked to the consolidation of assets and liabilities for related entities. Information on a nationality basis is useful to analyse potential support that might be available from the parent company and to understand links between borrowers in different countries and sectors.
For example, the debts of a Cayman Islands subsidiary of a Brazilian bank may be guaranteed by the parent bank. Consistent with the approach taken in the international banking statistics, the BIS bases the nationality of an issuer on the residency of its controlling parent, regardless of any intermediate owners.

Nationality refers to the ultimate obligor, as opposed to the immediate borrower on a residence basis, and is linked to the consolidation of assets and liabilities for related entities. Information on a nationality basis is useful to analyse potential support that might be available from the parent company and to understand links between borrowers in different countries and sectors.
For example, the debts of a Cayman Islands subsidiary of a Brazilian bank may be guaranteed by the parent bank. Consistent with the approach taken in the international banking statistics, the BIS bases the nationality of an issuer on the residency of its controlling parent, regardless of any intermediate owners.

Nationality refers to the ultimate obligor, as opposed to the immediate borrower on a residence basis, and is linked to the consolidation of assets and liabilities for related entities.

For example, the debts of a Cayman Islands subsidiary of a Brazilian bank may be guaranteed by the parent bank. Consistent with the approach taken in the international banking statistics, the BIS bases the nationality of an issuer on the residency of its controlling parent, regardless of any intermediate owners.

Many series include both seasonally adjusted (SA) and not seasonally adjusted (NSA) data. Occasionally, updates to the data will not include sufficient seasonal factors to trigger a seasonal adjustment. In these cases, the NSA series will be updated normally; but the SA series will also be updated with the NSA data. The NSA series can be located here here (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU37167405552000001).

Some seasonally adjusted series may exhibit negative values because they are created from a seasonal adjustment process regardless of the actual meaning or interpretation of the given indicator."
