## Introduction to Routines

The OpenBB Terminal is a powerful open source investment research platform.

The more proefficient you get on the platform, the faster and more efficiently you are able to do investment research.

One of the concepts that OpenBB introduced early on was the concept of script routines. Read more [here[(https://docs.openbb.co/terminal/usage/guides/scripts-and-routines).

**TL;DR: You can create MACROS like in Excel to run a sequence of commands.**

E.g. by running `exe script.openbb` the following sequence could be executed

```
stocks/load AAPL/candle --ma 20/fa/epsfc/pt/est
```

which would lead to:

This allows to automate the process of investment research, and can improve user's experience by a significant margin.
