OpenBB Terminal v3.2.5 will be the last version made available.

As we transition our focus to the OpenBB Platform, this repository will soon be rebranded as OpenBB-finance/OpenBBPlatform.

However, we are committed to continuing our mission to democratize investment research by helping users and contributors with financial data integration and standardization.

To achieve that, we are working on a new CLI tool built on top of the OpenBB Platform that will soon be available to everyone for free.
