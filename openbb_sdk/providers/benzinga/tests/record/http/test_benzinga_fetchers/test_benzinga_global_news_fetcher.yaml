        DMT compound, SPL026&nbsp;and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs.)</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The
        trial studied the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
        (PK/PD) and exploratory efficacy of one 27.5 mg IV infusion of SPL026, both
        alone and in combination with SSRIs in 17 patients paired with support therapy,
        as follows:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t<p>The test cohort had
        12 patients on a stable -and insufficient- SSRIs treatment course, while the
        control cohort had 5 patients not using any pharmacological treatment for
        their depression symptoms.&nbsp;Patients were recruited with moderate to severe
        MDD.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t<p>SPL026 was well-tolerated by
        all 17 patients, with no apparent differences between both cohorts and&nbsp;no
        drug-related serious adverse events&nbsp;reported.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t<p>A
        total of 11 mild or moderate drug-related adverse events (AEs) were reported
        in both groups (8 in the SSRI cohort, 3 in the&nbsp;non-SSRI group) the&nbsp;majority
        of them resolved during the dosing visit.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t<p>Results
        reaffirmed SPL026&rsquo;s efficacy (shown in a prior <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/01/30573674/small-pharma-incs-psychedelics-for-major-depression-trial-results-and-q1-earnings\\\">Phase
        2a study</a>) in the non-SSRI cohort, yet the treatment showed &ldquo;marked,&rdquo;
        greater antidepressant effects in the SSRI cohort, suggesting a &ldquo;potentially
        enhanced efficacy effect&rdquo; when administered jointly with SSRIs.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While
        the prior Phase 1/2a trial assessed the safety and efficacy profile of SPL026
        paired with support therapy alone, the&nbsp;fact of not requesting MDD patients
        to drop their SSRIs would expectedly enable broader patient recruitment for
        future, large-scale SPL026 studies, accelerate its clinical development, and
        facilitate patient access&nbsp;earlier within their therapeutic journey, if
        approved.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>CMO<strong> Dr. Carol Routledge</strong> said
        that while the team was &ldquo;very pleased&rdquo; to find patients may not
        need to&nbsp;withdraw&nbsp;from their SSRIs, they were not expecting to see
        &ldquo;such a marked difference in efficacy&rdquo; when administering SPL026
        in combination with SSRIs compared to SPL026 alone.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&ldquo;The
        potentially enhanced efficacy effect of a DMT-based treatment when administered
        with SSRIs could lead to greater therapeutic benefit for patients, and a compelling
        argument for positioning it earlier in the treatment pathway. This was a small
        study, but the findings are both interesting and encouraging and warrant further
        exploration,&rdquo; Routledge explained.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>CEO George
        Tziras</strong> added that these safety and tolerability results &ldquo;further

        to the FTC.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>John Newman</strong>, deputy director
        of the FTC&#39;s Bureau of Competition, said Amazon&#39;s monopolistic behavior
        results in higher consumer prices and high fees for online sellers.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The
        complaint focuses on what the FTC said is Amazon&#39;s anticompetitive conduct
        in the online superstore and marketplace services markets.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The
        suit claims that Amazon employs tactics like anti-discounting measures and
        conditioning sellers&#39; &quot;Prime&quot; eligibility on costly fulfillment
        services, limiting competitors&#39; ability to compete effectively.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Amazon&#39;s
        exclusionary practices, including replacing organic search results with paid
        ads and biasing search results toward its products, make it impossible for
        competitors to gain traction, according to the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The
        company charges substantial fees, forcing sellers to pay close to 50% of their
        revenues to Amazon, leading to increased consumer prices, the lawsuit said.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The
        FTC and state partners seek a permanent injunction to stop what they say is
        Amazon&#39;s unlawful conduct and restore competition in the market.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Between
        being paid for its logistics program, advertising, and other services, &quot;Amazon

        said the FTC is straying from its consumer and competition protection mission.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>He
        argued that the practices challenged by the FTC have encouraged competition
        and innovation in the retail industry.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Zapolsky warned

        \",\"body\":\"<p>Looking into the current session, <strong>ASML Holding Inc.
        (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ASML#NASDAQ\\\">ASML</a>)</strong>
        shares are trading at $571.36, after a <strong>2.52%</strong> drop. Over the
        past month, the stock decreased by <strong>14.40%</strong>, but over the past
        year, it actually spiked by <strong>29.49%</strong>. With questionable short-term
        performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders
        might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio. </p>\\n<p><p><img

        alt=\\\"Past Year Chart\\\" /></p></p>\\n<h3>Evaluating ASML Holding P/E in
        Comparison to Its Peers</h3>\\n<p>The P/E ratio measures the current share
        price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the
        company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data
        and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&amp;P
        500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better
        in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily.
        It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price
        currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming
        quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends
        in the future. </p>\\n<p>ASML Holding has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E
        of <strong>38.98</strong> of the Semiconductors &amp; Semiconductor Equipment
        industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than
        its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. </p>\\n<p><p><img
        src=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1695751217_1.png\\\"
        alt=\\\"Guage\\\" /></p></p>\\n<p>In conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio
        is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has
        its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued,
        it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally,
        the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry
        trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore,
        investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics
        and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions. </p>\",\"url\":\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/09/34921752/pe-ratio-insights-for-asml-holding\",\"image\":[{\"size\":\"small\",\"url\":\"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_18.jpeg\"},{\"size\":\"large\",\"url\":\"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_18.jpeg\"},{\"size\":\"thumb\",\"url\":\"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_18.jpeg\"}],\"channels\":[{\"name\":\"News\"},{\"name\":\"Intraday

        Are Analyst Ratings Determined?</h1>\\n<p>Ratings come from analysts, or specialists
        within banking and financial systems that report for specific stocks or defined
        sectors (typically once per quarter for each stock). Analysts usually derive
        their information from company conference calls and meetings, financial statements,
        and conversations with important insiders to reach their decisions.</p>\\n<p>Some
        analysts will also offer forecasts for metrics like growth estimates, earnings,
        and revenue to provide further guidance on stocks. Investors who use analyst
        ratings should note that this specialized advice comes from humans and may
        be subject to error.</p>\\n<p>This article was generated by Benzinga's automated
