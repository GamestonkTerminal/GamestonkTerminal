        12 patients on a stable -and insufficient- SSRIs treatment course, while the

        MDD.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t<p>SPL026 was well-tolerated by
        all 17 patients, with no apparent differences between both cohorts and&nbsp;no
        drug-related serious adverse events&nbsp;reported.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t<p>A
        total of 11 mild or moderate drug-related adverse events (AEs) were reported
        in both groups (8 in the SSRI cohort, 3 in the&nbsp;non-SSRI group) the&nbsp;majority
        of them resolved during the dosing visit.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n\\t<p>Results
        reaffirmed SPL026&rsquo;s efficacy (shown in a prior <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/01/30573674/small-pharma-incs-psychedelics-for-major-depression-trial-results-and-q1-earnings\\\">Phase
        2a study</a>) in the non-SSRI cohort, yet the treatment showed &ldquo;marked,&rdquo;

        enhanced efficacy effect&rdquo; when administered jointly with SSRIs.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While
        the prior Phase 1/2a trial assessed the safety and efficacy profile of SPL026
        paired with support therapy alone, the&nbsp;fact of not requesting MDD patients
        to drop their SSRIs would expectedly enable broader patient recruitment for
        future, large-scale SPL026 studies, accelerate its clinical development, and
        facilitate patient access&nbsp;earlier within their therapeutic journey, if
        approved.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>CMO<strong> Dr. Carol Routledge</strong> said
        that while the team was &ldquo;very pleased&rdquo; to find patients may not
        need to&nbsp;withdraw&nbsp;from their SSRIs, they were not expecting to see
        &ldquo;such a marked difference in efficacy&rdquo; when administering SPL026
        in combination with SSRIs compared to SPL026 alone.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&ldquo;The
        potentially enhanced efficacy effect of a DMT-based treatment when administered
        with SSRIs could lead to greater therapeutic benefit for patients, and a compelling
        argument for positioning it earlier in the treatment pathway. This was a small
        study, but the findings are both interesting and encouraging and warrant further
        exploration,&rdquo; Routledge explained.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>CEO George
        Tziras</strong> added that these safety and tolerability results &ldquo;further

        services, limiting competitors&#39; ability to compete effectively.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Amazon&#39;s
        exclusionary practices, including replacing organic search results with paid

        company charges substantial fees, forcing sellers to pay close to 50% of their
        revenues to Amazon, leading to increased consumer prices, the lawsuit said.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The
        FTC and state partners seek a permanent injunction to stop what they say is

        \",\"body\":\"<p>Looking into the current session, <strong>ASML Holding Inc.
        (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ASML#NASDAQ\\\">ASML</a>)</strong>
        shares are trading at $571.36, after a <strong>2.52%</strong> drop. Over the
        past month, the stock decreased by <strong>14.40%</strong>, but over the past
        year, it actually spiked by <strong>29.49%</strong>. With questionable short-term
        performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders
        might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio. </p>\\n<p><p><img

        alt=\\\"Past Year Chart\\\" /></p></p>\\n<h3>Evaluating ASML Holding P/E in
        Comparison to Its Peers</h3>\\n<p>The P/E ratio measures the current share
        price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the
        company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data
        and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&amp;P
        500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better
        in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily.
        It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price
        currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming
        quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends
        in the future. </p>\\n<p>ASML Holding has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E
        of <strong>38.98</strong> of the Semiconductors &amp; Semiconductor Equipment
        industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than
        its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. </p>\\n<p><p><img
        src=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1695751217_1.png\\\"
        alt=\\\"Guage\\\" /></p></p>\\n<p>In conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio
        is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has
        its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued,
        it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally,
        the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry
        trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore,
        investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics
        and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions. </p>\",\"url\":\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/09/34921752/pe-ratio-insights-for-asml-holding\",\"image\":[{\"size\":\"thumb\",\"url\":\"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_18.jpeg\"},{\"size\":\"small\",\"url\":\"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_18.jpeg\"},{\"size\":\"large\",\"url\":\"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/images/story/2023/movers_image_18.jpeg\"}],\"channels\":[{\"name\":\"News\"},{\"name\":\"Intraday
