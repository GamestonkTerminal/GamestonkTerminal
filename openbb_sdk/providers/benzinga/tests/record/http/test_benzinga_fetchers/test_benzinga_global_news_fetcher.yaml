        are partners in business and life, having married in Toronto, Canada&nbsp;in

        to the biographer, what sets his work apart is that, unlike many authors who

        critical element that captivates and divides readers is the decision to tell

        officer and led Windows development and Microsoft&#8217;s Surface line. The

        team took apart the Lucid powertrain, separating the battery, the electric
        motors, the inverter, the differential, and the gearbox, among other things.
        The differential is a part of the rear wheel axle, which allows each rear
        wheel to turn at different speeds.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s smaller,
        it&#8217;s lighter, it&#8217;s everything you could possibly imagine that

        works brilliantly well, thing goes like a scalded cat,&#8221; he added. The
        automotive engineer also noted the 1,000 horsepower of the motor and said,
        &#8220;it&#8217;s ridiculous.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why It&#8217;s
        Important: </strong>Lucid sells high-end, luxury EVs, and its cheapest car,
        the Air Pure sedan, is priced at $82,400. The company has found the going
        tough as the economic uncertainty weighs down on consumer spending on discretionary
        items such as cars.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The second-quarter results released
        in early August showed the company missed on all main metrics, including revenue
        and earnings, as deliveries undershot guidance by 600 vehicles. As Lucid goes
        through the throes of an upstart, it has managed to <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/06/33046871/whats-going-on-with-lucid-lcid-stock\\\">keep
        operations going with the help of its Saudi promoters.</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Lucid
        ended Monday&#8217;s session down 4.73% at $5.64, according to <a href=\\\"https://benzinga.grsm.io/lxquj26b2sag\\\">Benzinga
