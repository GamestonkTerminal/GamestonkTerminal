        officer and led Windows development and Microsoft&#8217;s Surface line. The

        the iPhone</a> on Jan. 9, 2007, at its Macworld event. Then CEO <strong>Steve

        would have turned out.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>Related Link: <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/23/09/34506430/apple-has-flex-the-muscles-moment-with-iphone-15-expects-mini-supercycle-to-propel-\\\">Apple

        over iPhones: </strong>Apple released the first iPhone in 2007 and has released
        a new model every year since that time, with some years having multiple releases
        and new updates.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For the purpose of this exercise, one new
        iPhone model was considered for each year. Stock prices are the opening price
        for each iPhone release date and are split adjusted for a 7-for-1 split in
        2014 and a 4-for-1 split in 2020. Dividends are not factored into the starting
        price or return.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The release dates and starting prices for
        the iPhone models come from <a href=\\\"https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/iphone-evolution-timeline-chart\\\">Bankmycell</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Here&rsquo;s
        a look at the returns for the iPhones with their release date, starting price,
        Apple stock price at the time, number of shares that could have been purchased
        and current value based on Apple shares at $178.19.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>iPhone,

        you can see from the chart above, each year investing in Apple stock instead
        of buying an iPhone would have generated a better return for investors, including
        the release of iPhone 14 last year.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Adding it all
        up, a person would spend $12,584 to buy a new iPhone model each year since
        2007. If that same amount was put into Apple stock each year on the day of
        the new phone release, an investor would have $117,764.18 today.</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This
        represents a profit of $105,180.18 and a return of 835.8% over the past 16
        years.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While you wouldn&rsquo;t be a millionaire doing the
        strategy of investing in Apple stock over the iPhone using this method, it
        represents an impressive return.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>Read Next: <a href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/23/09/34499256/how-to-earn-500-a-month-from-apple-stock-just-in-time-for-new-products\\\">How

        has risen by over 30% since its low point in March. With consumption hitting
        record highs and production cuts in Saudi Arabia and Russia tightening supplies,
        refiners are snapping up barrels to meet fuel production needs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Amrita

        oil to briefly touch this milestone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Examples abound in
        the physical markets, with Azerbaijani Azeri Light crude trading near $100
        a barrel due to high profits in converting crude to diesel. Similarly, Russian

        working on this project in July 2021.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Although there were
        delays and changes in Microsoft&#39;s cloud gaming plans over the past year,
        hints about bringing PC games to Xbox Cloud Gaming emerged, including a partnership
        with British mobile network EE.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Microsoft also began testing
        mouse and keyboard support for Xbox Cloud Gaming, but initially only for Xbox
        console games.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the same email chain, Spencer shared his
        thoughts on <strong>Google Stadia</strong>, speculating that Google might
        shift Stadia towards a Google Cloud service and abandon its first-party consumer
        gaming service.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&quot;Google is a massive and aggressive
        competitor but honestly I&rsquo;ve been surprised by their lack of progress
        with Stadia. To date, our #1 competitor here is really nVidia with GeForce

        Intermediate crude (WTI).&nbsp;WTI, as tracked by the United States Oil Fund
        ETF (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/USO#NYSE\\\">USO</a>)
        is the standard for the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Brent crude.&nbsp;Brent is trading
        about $3 above WTI.&nbsp;$100 price for Brent is the magnet for traders.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>The
        chart shows a steep trendline.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>The main reason for the rise
        in oil price shown on the chart is that Saudi Arabia, in cooperation with
        Russia and other OPEC+ members, have successfully reduced the supply.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>The
        latest government stimulus in China may increase demand for oil in China.&nbsp;This
        is adding to the bullishness.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Resilient&nbsp;U.S. economic
        data and American consumers&rsquo; willingness to spend is adding to the upward
        pressure on oil.&nbsp;In the past when gasoline prices rose, consumers would
        cut back on other discretionary purchases.&nbsp;However, this time is proving
        to be different so far. Rising gas prices are not having a negative impact
        on other discretionary purchases by American consumers.&nbsp;The American
        consumer has become used to excessive spending.&nbsp;Right now, lower income
        consumers can still borrow and higher income consumers still have savings.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Also
        contributing to higher oil prices is general risk-on sentiment generated by
        higher stock prices and house prices holding up in spite of higher interest
        rates.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>The fear is that Saudi Arabia and Russia may want
        to tighten the screws on the West by trying to run up oil prices to $120 -
        $130.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>For more guidance, refer to world renown oil ratings
        from The Arora Report. You can see the oil ratings from the top menu in the
        Real Time Feeds. These ratings are based on the following:\\r\\n\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>Geopolitics</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>Sentiment</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>Fund
        Flows</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>Supply</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>Demand</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>Inventories</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>Positioning</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>Technicals</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>Risk
        Appetite</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>Economic Indicators</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>Currencies</li>\\r\\n\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>FOMC,
        Bank of England, and Bank of Japan meetings are ahead this week.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Rising
        oil prices are making the job of fighting inflation difficult for the Fed
        and the Bank of England.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Japan imports almost all of the
        oil it uses.&nbsp;Rising oil prices may force the Bank of Japan to change
        its loose monetary policy.&nbsp;<strong>In The Arora Report analysis, if the
        Bank of Japan changes its loose monetary policy, it will have a negative impact
        on stocks in the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;The reason is that there is a lot of money
        that has been borrowed in Japan at low interest rates and then invested in
        the&nbsp;U.S. stock market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li>\\r\\n\\t<li>A&nbsp;concern
        is also developing about a potential government shutdown.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>On
        the positive side, early indications are that preorders for iPhone 15 are
        better than expected.&nbsp;This is good news because <strong>Apple Inc</strong>
        (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\\\">AAPL</a>)

        is seeing aggressive buying and is now about $27,000.&nbsp;The buying is due

        very, very short-term early stock market indicator is <strong>&#128274;</strong>.&nbsp;This
        indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors
        to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently
        undertake quick trades.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3><strong>Protection Band And What
        To Do Now</strong></h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is important for investors to look
        ahead and not in the rearview mirror.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Consider continuing
        to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk
        preference, consider holding <strong>&#128274;</strong> in cash or Treasury
        bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term
        hedges of <strong>&#128274;</strong>, and short term hedges of <strong>&#128274;</strong>.
        This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the
        same time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You can determine your protection bands by adding
        cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who
        are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for
        those who are younger or aggressive.&nbsp;If you do not hedge, the total cash
        level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus
        hedges.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>It is worth reminding that you cannot take
        advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.&nbsp;</strong>When
        adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock
        positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and
        also allowing more room for high beta stocks.&nbsp;High beta stocks are the
        ones that move more than the market.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3><strong>Traditional
        60/40 Portfolio</strong></h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Probability based risk reward
        adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation
        at this time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Those who want to stick to traditional 60%
        allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality
        bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.&nbsp;Those willing to bring
        sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical
        positions and not strategic positions at this time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The
        Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.&nbsp;The Arora Report correctly
        called the 2008 financial crash, the start of a mega bull market in 2009,

        not alone.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It&#39;s one of the key reasons retail investors
        flock to <a href=\\\"https://www.tickernerd.com/resources/best-investment-newsletters/\\\">investment
        newsletters</a> in search of the next up-and-coming stock.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But
        let&#39;s face it: Investing in the stock market can sometimes feel like a
        roller coaster you never signed up for. The highs are thrilling, but the lows?
        Well, they can keep you up at night.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Luckily, there&#39;s
        a way to smooth out those ups and downs while potentially getting even&nbsp;<strong><em>better</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>returns.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Introducing:
        Alternative investments</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&quot;Alts&quot; include investments
        like private equity, real estate, commodities, art, fine wine, and more.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>And
        J.P. Morgan Asset Management recently found that including a mix of 30% alternatives
        would have resulted in&nbsp;<strong>better risk/return outcomes&nbsp;</strong>when
        compared to portfolios with allocations of:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>40%
        stocks and 60% bonds</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>60% stocks and 40% bonds</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>80%
        stocks and 20% bonds</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The takeaway is clear.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Decreasing
        exposure to traditional stock and bond markets, and instead allocating some
        funds to alts, can produce more &quot;bang for your buck.&quot;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In
        essence, there are 3&nbsp;reasons to buy alts:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>1. Diversification</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>2.
        Risk management</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>3. Improved risk-adjusted returns</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But
        of course, <a href=\\\"https://themoneymaniac.com/best-alternative-investments\\\">alternative
        investments</a> aren&#39;t without their risks. After all,&nbsp;no investment
        is a magic money tree. If you consider investing in one of these alts, be
        cautious of the following:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Less regulation</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Less
        liquidity</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Less transparency</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Higher fees
        and commissions</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Limited price discovery</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>However,
        the longer your investment time horizon, the&nbsp;more these risks can potentially
        be mitigated.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For most retail investors, completely replacing
        traditional stocks and bonds with alts isn&#39;t the goal. Instead, consider
        them as an additional tool in your investment toolkit, a way to enhance and
        diversify your portfolio.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Many of the world&#39;s wealthiest
        investors and institutions have been using alternative investments to their
        advantage for years. It&#39;s not about abandoning the stock market, but about
        leveraging other opportunities to achieve a broader, more resilient portfolio.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So
        remember, the stock market isn&#39;t the only game in town.&nbsp;By integrating
        alternative investments into your strategy, you stand a chance at smoother
        sailing, diversified risks, and potentially even greater returns.</p>\\r\\n\",\"url\":\"https://www.benzinga.com/23/09/34699840/tired-of-the-wall-street-drama-heres-how-to-unlock-better-returns-lower-risk\",\"image\":[{\"size\":\"thumb\",\"url\":\"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/250x187xUP/real-estate-investing-alts.jpg\"},{\"size\":\"small\",\"url\":\"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/1024x768xUP/real-estate-investing-alts.jpg\"},{\"size\":\"large\",\"url\":\"https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/2048x1536xUP/real-estate-investing-alts.jpg\"}],\"channels\":[{\"name\":\"Markets\"},{\"name\":\"Personal

        resounding oil rally.</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>WTI-graded crude oil has experienced
        a remarkable ascent of over 30% since mid-June. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This dramatic
        increase can be attributed to a combination of factors, including supply constraints
        resulting from production cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia, as well as a robust
        U.S. economy that has sustained demand for oil.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>During the

        exhibited a staggering 39% increase, marking the best first half of the year
        since the inception of the index. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Much of this surge was
        fueled by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, which catapulted tech stocks
        to new heights, defying the interest rate gravity. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Nonetheless,
        during the last three months, the tech-dominated index has displayed a flat
        performance, suggesting a stalemate in the previously prominent AI-fueled
        surge that defined the earlier market landscape. In contrast, energy stocks,
        as monitored through <strong>the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund</strong> (NYSE:<a
        class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/XLE#NYSE\\\">XLE</a>),

        \u2014 over the same time period. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This interaction between

        Google penetrated into financial service and realized significant gains with
        mobile wallets, America&rsquo;s biggest banks have joined their efforts to
        defend their turf. Namely, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\"
        href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/JPM#NYSE\\\">JPM</a>), Bank of America
        Corporation (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BAC#NYSE\\\">BAC</a>)
        and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/WFC#NYSE\\\">WFC</a>),
        among others, will be launching a mobile wallet that will connect to credit
        and debit card accounts of 150 million customers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Fintech
        Partnerships Have Been In The Air For A&nbsp;While Now&hellip;</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Fintech
        has been taking a bite out of traditional banking. In April, Apple continued
        its iBanking revolution that began with Apple Pay by joining forces with The
        Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GS#NYSE\\\">GS</a>)
        to release its Apple Card high-yield savings account. Goldman Sachs is known
        for embracing technological development to meet the needs of its tech-savvy
        customers. But, even other offline banks entered the fintech game.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For
        example, JPMorgan has struck deals with both Apple and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:<a
        class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\\\">AMZN</a>)
        that will fuel the two tech titans to expand their banking footprints. Amazon
        also got the help of Citigroup Inc (NYSE:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/C#NYSE\\\">C</a>)
        with its instalment payment offering.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Big Banks&rsquo;
        Mobile Wallet</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Named Paze, the banks&rsquo; soon to be launched
        digital wallet will be operated by Early Warning Services. This bank consortium
        group already runs the payments app Zelle which became the largest-peer-to-peer
        payment app pretty quickly since its launch in 2017 so no wonder that big
        banks are hoping that the same formula will help replicate this success. Last
        year, payments over Zelle increased almost 30% to&nbsp;$629 billion while
        PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:<a class=\\\"ticker\\\" href=\\\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/PYPL#NASDAQ\\\">PYPL</a>)-owned
        Venmo&rsquo;s score was only $244 million and PayPal acquired Venmo back in
        2013, four years after its inception. Even PayPal got pressured by Apple&rsquo;s
        entry into digital payments and is undergoing a business turnaround. Venmo
        has long been seen as the source of long-term growth for PayPal but it still
        didn&#39;t get to a point of becoming a&nbsp;significant revenue contributor.
        Despite the digital payments platform&#39;s&nbsp;pioneering&nbsp;journey,
        PayPal management&rsquo;s guided for lackluster&nbsp;gross profit growth.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Fintech
        Partnerships Are Here To Stay</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Paze shows that rivaling
        banks are willing to work together and to use the expertise of tech firm to
        stop Apple, Google and most recently, X, whose goal is to offer banking services.
        Although Financial Times quoted a market research study that merely 6% of
        global purchases was made by Apple Pay, the number of users skyrocketed in
        five years, going from 60 million to now exceeding 500 million and that is
        making banks nervous.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Yet, fintech partnership are
        not favored by regulators whose concern is that such unions expose the U.S.
        banking system to non-trustworthy players.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Putting
        The Genie Back In The Bottle Is An Unlikely Scenario</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Big
        Tech is certainly giving Big Banks a run for their money as Apple, Amazon
        and Google are poised to challenge the power that banks have enjoyed for a
        very long time and the mobile wallet is now the biggest battleground in this
        tussle. Many believe that banks are not able to put the Apple, Amazon and
        Google genie back in the bottle as the history of the industry is filled with
        advancements that ultimately became industry standards.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>DISCLAIMER:

        immediate response internally to Sony's PlayStation price hike was not one
        of announcing a similar Xbox price hike \u2013 in fact, Microsoft executives

        vs Microsoft case</a> has unearthed new internal communication at Microsoft,
        revealing that while the Windows maker was expecting a PlayStation price hike,
        its plans to counter were simply not to announce a similar Xbox price hike.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>See

        sales and marketing, said, \\\"we know this could be our time to win fans

        by The Verge.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Back in August 2022, Sony <a href=\\\"https://blog.playstation.com/2022/08/25/ps5-price-to-increase-in-select-markets-due-to-global-economic-environment-including-high-inflation-rates/\\\">announced</a>
        a price hike across several key markets. The company blamed it on the \\\"global
        economic environment, including high inflation rates.\\\"</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However,
        Microsoft decided not to hike Xbox prices because the company's gaming console
        lagged behind PlayStation in sales.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In fact, Microsoft explicitly
        admitted to this prior to the FTC hearing. \\\"Xbox has lost the console wars,
        and its rivals are positioned to continue to dominate, including by leveraging
        exclusive content,\\\" said Microsoft.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Behind In
        Performance:</strong> Xbox lagged behind the PlayStation 5 in terms of sales
        and performance.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Microsoft's internal discussions revealed
        several key parameters like SSD performance, optimizations for developers
        in terms of higher throughput, and more.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Silverman agreed
        with Phil Spencer, Microsoft's head of games, that they need to keep Xbox
        gamer-focused. However, the reasoning suggested a wider mood across the company
        that the PlayStation was at a clear advantage.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>\\\"All good
        points, let's be gamer obsessed here as we have not gotten out of the woods,\\\"

        too crazy last week, despite both CPI and PPI data coming in. Noteworthy that

        remained inside previous bearish imbalance from March 2022, but like ES, refused
        to take out the previous weekly high. Small support level at 15200 and liquidity
        resting at 14804. Not expecting much until Wednesday.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><img

        out my YouTube video on it. To me, the dollar is the best indicator you can

        of a daily bearish volume imbalance sends ES down hard on Friday. Price did
        hold inside the bullish imbalance from August. Currently in discount, I would
        favor a move below 4483, to take liquidity, and from there potential upside.
        Bears shift the tides on a move below 4414.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://public-files.gumroad.com/i2wr7li2f1ktcv9womb199lvzeso\\\"

        bearish volume imbalance on the daily, sending price back down to equilibrium
        of the range, perfect setup for an FOMC week... 15132 would be the lowest

        - Meltdown! Yet to take out swing low liquidity at 442.64. If the range is
        set here, I&#39;d favor a bounce to start the week, getting into the bearish

        swept swing high and dumped hard Friday. Retraced back into a discount bearish
        imbalance before fading to a new low. A move above the most recent swing high

        on Friday, but like GOOGL, market structure remains bullish. Bears don&#39;t
        take over unless swing low at 138.50 is taken out for me. Bulls want to see
        that liquidity at the 140.01 low swept and an immediate bounce from there.
        That would be the perfect golden pocket bounce, as it did the first time around.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><img
