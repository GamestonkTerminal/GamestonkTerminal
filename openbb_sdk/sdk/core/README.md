## 1. Introduction

This is a collection of functions that allow extracting, transforming and exporting financial data.

These functions are special:

- They provide configuration
- They will be automatically turned into REST API endpoint
- They allow sharing data between commands


## 2. How to install?

**GIT CLONE**

Git clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal.git
```

**INSTALL**

Go to `openbb_sdk` folder and install the package.

```bash
cd openbb_sdk
poetry install
```


## 3. How to add an extension?

**PROJECT**

Build a Python package:

```bash
poetry new openbb-sdk-my_extension
```

**COMMAND**

Add a router and a command.

```python
# File my_extension/extension_router.py

from openbb_core.app.router import Router

router = Router(prefix="/router_name")

@router.command
def some_command(
    some_param: some_param_type,
) -> CommandOutput[Item]:
    pass
```

If your command only makes use of a `openbb-provider` model, there is no need to repeat its structure in the parameters. Just pass the model name as an argument. This is an example how we do it for `stocks.load` which only depends on `StockEOD` model defined in `openbb-provider`.
```python
@router.command(model="StockEOD")
def load(
    cc: CommandContext,                 # user settings inside
    provider_choices: ProviderChoices,  # available providers
    standard_params: StandardParams,    # symbol, start_date, etc.
    extra_params: ExtraParams,          # provider specific parameters
) -> CommandOutput[BaseModel]:
    """Load stock data for a specific ticker."""
    return CommandOutput(results=Query(**locals()).execute())
```

**ENTRYPOINT**

Add an entrypoint for the extension inside your `pyproject.toml` file.

```toml
# File pyproject.toml
packages = [{include = "openbb_sdk_my_extension"}]
...
[tool.poetry.extensions."openbb_extensions"]
extension_name_space = "my_extension.extension_router:router"
```

**INSTALL**

Install your extension.

```bash
cd openbb_sdk_my_extension
poetry install
```

# 4. Usage

Update the settings

```
# FILE <your_home_directory>/.openbb_sdk/user_settings.json
{
    "credentials": {
        "benzinga_api_key": null,
        "fmp_api_key": null,
        "polygon_api_key": null
    },
    "defaults": {
        "routes": {
            "/stocks/fa/balance": {
                "provider": "polygon"
            },
            "/stocks/load": {
                "provider": "fmp"
            },
            "/stocks/news": {
                "provider": "benzinga"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```
# FILE <your_home_directory>/.openbb_sdk/system_settings.json
{
    "run_in_isolation": null,
    "dbms_uri": null
}
```

## 4.1 Static version

Run your command:

```python
from openbb import sdk

output = sdk.stocks.load(
    symbol="TSLA",
    start_date="2023-01-01",
    provider="fmp",
    chart=True
    )
```

### 4.1.1. Command output

Each command will always return a  `CommandOutput`. There you will find:

- `results`: the data returned by the command `None`
- `provider`: the provider name (only available provider names allowed) used to get the data or `None`
- `warnings`: `List[Warning_]` with warnings caught during the command execution or `None`
- `error`: an `Error` with any exception that occurred during the command execution or `None`
- `chart`: a `Chart` with chart data and format or `None`

**HELPERS**

To help you manipulate or visualize the data we make some helpers available.

- `to_dataframe`: transforms `results` into a pandas DataFrame
```python
>>> output.to_dataframe()
              open    high       low   close   adj_close    ...
date
2023-07-21  268.00  268.00  255.8000  260.02  260.019989    ...
2023-07-20  279.56  280.93  261.2000  262.90  262.899994    ...
2023-07-19  296.04  299.29  289.5201  291.26  291.260010    ...
```

- `to_dict`: transforms `results` into a dict of lists
```python
>>> output.to_dict()
{
    'open': [268.0, 279.56, 296.04],
    'high': [268.0, 280.93, 299.29],
    'low': [255.8, 261.2, 289.5201],
    'close': [260.02, 262.9, 291.26],
    'adj_close': [260.019989, 262.899994, 291.26001],
    ...
}
```

- `show`: displays `chart.content` to a chart
```python
>>> output.show()
# Jupyter Notebook: inline chart
# Python Interpreter: opens a PyWry window with the chart
```

- `to_plotly_json`: proxy to `chart.content`
```python
>>> output.to_plotly_json()
{'data':
    [
        {
            'close': [260.02, 262.9, 291.26],
            'decreasing': {'line': {'width': 1.1}},
            'high': [268.0, 280.93, 299.29],
            'increasing': {'line': {'width': 1.1}},
            ...
        }
    ...
    ]
}
```

### 4.1.2. Utilities

**SETTINGS**

These are your user settings, you can change them at anytime and they will be applied. Don't forget to `sdk.account.save()` if you want these changes to persist.

```python
from openbb import sdk

sdk.settings.profile
sdk.settings.credentials
sdk.settings.preferences
sdk.settings.defaults
```

**SYSTEM**

Check your system settings. Most of the properties are read-only during runtime, so any changes there will be void.

- `debug_mode`: here if you set `debug_mode = True` any exception that occurs during execution will be raised immediately.

```python
from openbb import sdk

sdk.system
```

**COVERAGE**
```python
>>> sdk.coverage.commands
{
    '/crypto/load': ['fmp', 'polygon'],
    '/economy/const': ['fmp'],
    '/economy/cpi': ['fred'],
    ...
}
```

```python
>>> sdk.coverage.providers
{
    'fmp':
    [
        '/crypto/load',
        '/economy/const',
        '/economy/index',
        ...
    ],
    'fred': ['/economy/cpi'],
    ...
}
```

### 4.1.3. OpenBB Hub account

```python
from openbb import sdk

# Login with email, password or SDK token
sdk.account.login(email="your_email", password="your_password", remember_me=True)  # pragma: allowlist secret

# Change a credential
sdk.account.settings.credentials.polygon_api_key = "new_key"  # pragma: allowlist secret

# Save account changes
sdk.account.save()

# Refresh account with latest changes
sdk.account.refresh()

# Logout
sdk.account.logout()
```

## 4.2 Dynamic version

You can also use the dynamic version to consume the api endpoints from Python itself.
In fact, the static version makes use of this feature to run each command. Take a look at the example below.

```python
>>> from openbb_core.app.command_runner import CommandRunnerSession
>>> crs = CommandRunnerSession()
>>> response = crs.run(
             "/stocks/load",
             provider_choices={
                 "provider": "fmp",
             },
             standard_params={
                 "symbol": "TSLA",
                 "start_date": "2023-07-01",
                 "end_date": "2023-07-25",
             },
             extra_params={},
             chart=True,
         )
>>> response
JournalEntry

id: ...                 # UUID Tag
arguments: ...          # Arguments of the command.
duration ...            # Execution duration in nano second of the command.
output ...              # Output of the command.
route: "/stocks/load"   # Route of the command.
timestamp: ...          # Execution starting timestamp.
alias_list: ...         # List of alias to find a JournalEntry easier than with it's `tag`.

>>> response.output
CommandOutput

id: ...                 # UUID Tag
results: ...            # Serializable results.
provider: ...           # Provider name.
warnings: ...           # List of warnings.
error: ...              # Exception caught.
chart: ...              # Chart object.
```

## 5. REST API

OpenBB SDK comes with a ready to use Rest API built with FastAPI.

```
# FILE <your_home_directory>/.openbb_sdk/user_settings.json
{
    "credentials": {
        "benzinga_api_key": null,
        "fmp_api_key": null,
        "polygon_api_key": null
    },
    "defaults": {
        "routes": {
            "/stocks/fa/balance": {
                "provider": "polygon"
            },
            "/stocks/load": {
                "provider": "fmp"
            },
            "/stocks/news": {
                "provider": "benzinga"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```
# FILE <your_home_directory>/.openbb_sdk/system_settings.json
{
    "run_in_isolation": null,
    "dbms_uri": null
}
```

Start the application:

```bash
uvicorn openbb_core.api.rest_api:app --reload
```

## 5.1 Test users

There are 2 default users for testing purpose:

User "openbb"
- username : openbb
- password : openbb


User "finance"
- username : finance
- password : finance

## 6. Front-end typing

Here are libraries to get frontend typing.
