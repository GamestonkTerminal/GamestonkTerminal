When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

If you're not a developer, but want to be part of this movement, there are plenty of things that you can do to help. Here are some of them:
Star the repo and share it with your friends,
Use it on your reddit DD posts (e.g. u/Appropriate_Elk_3827),
Get in contact with people that have websites with relevant data (this is how we have a government menu using quiverquant)
Search for other modules on github that we could use in the project (the developer of Moonbag is keen on adding his crypto terminal in our repo, so that more people can benefit from it)
Test the terminal and report bugs, or develop new feature ideas (from where to get the data, to display to the user). Both can be reported in here
If you managed to install it succsessfully, helping other people on discord that are struggling on the install in the same place that you are is extremely valuable to us
Improve our documentation, either README or help functions of the terminal
Create content (e.g. youtube videos) using the terminal. It would be great if a content creator did a video on each of our menus, so that we could create a series on how to fully use GST


There are 3 main ways of contributing to this project.

Recommended if you adopted a strategy of buying high and selling low.

We are interested in your view on what sort of features would make you buy even higher and selling even lower.

Also, if somehow you're sitting in several mils due to this terminal, don't forget to report a bug so that the team can fix, and keep the old ways.
