## How Can I Contribute?

When contributing to this repository, feel free to discuss the change you wish to make via discord https://discord.gg/Up2QGbMKHY!

#### Community/Marketing

Increase Gamestonk Terminal reach:

  * Star the repo.
  * Pass the word to your friends/family.
  * Create content (e.g. youtube videos) using Gamestonk Terminal.

  * Join our discord and interact with other users.

#### Retail Trader/QA

If you are the typical retail trader that uses the terminal on a daily basis, there are a lot of ways you can con contribute:

  * Test Terminal's features.
  * Report bugs or even sketch new feature ideas (we have a large dev community since we're open source, hence there's a lot we can do).
  * Improve our documentation or even features by suggesting enhancements.
  * Search for more APIs that we can add to our terminal.
  * Search websites that we can scrape useful data for free.
  * Contact interesting people in our behalf towards partnerships which will provide our user base with more data.
  * Reach out to developers/mathematicians/data scientists/finance people to help us build the #1 Retail Trader terminal.

#### Programmers

For a 1h coding session where the (old) architecture of the repo is explained while a new feature is added, check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BMI9cleTTg.

The fact that this is an Open Source project makes the possibilities of contributing pretty much unlimited. In here you should consider what do you want to gain out of this experience of contributing, some examples we've seen since the repository is live:

  * Machine Learning engineers working on our prediction models
  * Data Scientists improving our algoritms to make sense out of the data
  * Mathematicians exploring our residual analysis menu
  * Finance students evaluating a DCF spreadsheet from terminal's data
  * DevOps engineers making the repository more robust and ensuring good practices

Throughout the code we're leaving `# TODO` flags behind for tasks that aren't high priority, but still a good-to-have. So if you would be happy to work on anything, you can search for these on the project and let us know you'll be tackling it.

The steps to contribute are:
1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature)
3. Commit your Changes (git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature')
4. Install the pre-commit hooks by running: pre-commit install. Any time you commit a change, linters will be run automatically. On changes, you will have to re-commit.
5. Push to your Branch (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature)
6. Open a Pull Request
