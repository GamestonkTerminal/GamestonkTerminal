Enter the menu from the <a href="https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/stocks/" target="_blank">`Stocks`</a> menu by typing `disc` and pressing `enter`. Absolute path jumping is possible from anywhere, to anywhere. For example, jumping from the Portfolio Optimization submenu to the Stocks Discovery submenu:
