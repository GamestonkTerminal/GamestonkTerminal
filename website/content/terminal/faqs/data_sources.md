## Data and Sources

Please note that OpenBB does not provide any data, it is an aggregator which provides users access to data from a variety of sources. OpenBB does not maintain or have any control over the raw data supplied. If there is a specific problem with the output from a data provider, please consider contacting them first.

<details><summary>Data from today is missing.</summary>

By default, the load function requests end-of-day daily data and is not included until the EOD summary has been published. The current day's data is considered intraday and is loaded when the `interval` argument is present.

```console
load SPY -i 60
```

</details>

<details><summary>Can I stream live prices and news feeds?</summary>

The OpenBB Terminal is not currently capable of streaming live feeds through websocket connections.

</details>

<details><summary>"Pair BTC/USDT not found in binance"</summary>

US-based users are currently unable to access the Binance API. Please try loading the pair from a different source, for example:

`load btc --source CCXT --exchange kraken`

</details>

## General Troubleshooting

Both Windows and MacOS provide a "developer mode", and enabling it may help.

**MacOS**: Go to the System Settings, and under the "Privacy and Security" tab, scroll to the bottom and select the option to "Allow applications downloaded from App Store and identified developers". Then, scroll up to click on, "Developer Tools", and add `Terminal.app` and `Visual Studio Code` (or the preferred code editor) to the list of applications allowed to run software locally that does not meet the system's security policy.

**Windows**: Go to the Control Panel, and under the "Privacy & Security" tab, click on, "For developers". Under this menu, turn "Developer Mode" on.

From the Windows Security menu, click on the Firewall & Network Protection tab, then click on "Allow an app through firewall". If the applications below are not allowed to communicate through Windows Defender Firewall, change the settings to allow.

- BranchCache
- Hyper-V
- VcXsrv
- Windows Terminal
