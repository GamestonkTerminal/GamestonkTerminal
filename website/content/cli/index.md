## What is the OpenBB Platform CLI?

The OpenBB Platform CLI is a wrapper around the OpenBB Platform, this means that one can expect it to have the same functionalities that the OpenBB Platform offers with the enhancements and limitations that a command line interface brings. The CLI is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to interact with the platform and access its pre-built data connectors and libraries.

The OpenBB Platform CLI is the OpenBB's sub product that intends to offer a replacement for the former [OpenBB Terminal](/terminal). This means that the navigation and usage of the CLI are similar to the Terminal, but with the added benefit of being able to access the OpenBB Platform's data connectors and libraries, i.e., the OpenBB Core and OpenBB Extensions.

Starting with V4, we have completely restructured the previous version of the OpenBB SDK.
Instead of a single monolithic SDK, that comes with dependency nightmares and compatibility issues with things you may not need, we have morphed into the OpenBB Platform, which serves as a collection of building blocks to be used for your own need.
