## Help arguments

A help dialogue for any function at the current location is printed to the screen by typing `-h` or `--help` after the command. The information returned contains a short description of the function and all accepted arguments. For example the `news` command will return:

```console
(ðŸ¦‹) /news/ $ company --help

usage: company [--symbol SYMBOL [SYMBOL ...]] [--start_date START_DATE] [--end_date END_DATE] [--limit LIMIT] [--provider {benzinga,fmp,intrinio,polygon,tiingo,tmx,yfinance}]
               [--date DATE] [--display {headline,abstract,full}] [--updated_since UPDATED_SINCE] [--published_since PUBLISHED_SINCE] [--sort {id,created,updated}]

               [--source {yahoo,moody,moody_us_news,moody_us_press_releases}] [--sentiment {positive,neutral,negative}] [--language LANGUAGE] [--topic TOPIC]
               [--word_count_greater_than WORD_COUNT_GREATER_THAN] [--word_count_less_than WORD_COUNT_LESS_THAN] [--is_spam]
               [--business_relevance_greater_than BUSINESS_RELEVANCE_GREATER_THAN] [--business_relevance_less_than BUSINESS_RELEVANCE_LESS_THAN] [--offset OFFSET] [-h]
               [--export EXPORT] [--sheet-name SHEET_NAME [SHEET_NAME ...]]

  --limit LIMIT         The number of data entries to return.
  --provider {benzinga,fmp,intrinio,polygon,tiingo,tmx,yfinance}
                        The provider to use for the query, by default None.
                            If None, the provider specified in defaults is selected or 'benzinga' if there is
                            no default.

```


## Auto-complete

![Auto Complete](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85772166/233247702-f707531c-2c65-4380-a662-cd4bc2ae0199.png)

The OpenBB Platform CLI is equipped with an auto completion engine that presents choices based on the current menu and command. Whenever you start typing, suggestion prompts will appear for existing commands and menus. When the command contains arguments, pressing the `space bar` after typing the command will present the list of available arguments. Note that a menu doesn't has arguments attached.

This functionality dramatically reduces the number of key strokes required to perform tasks and, in many cases, eliminates the need to consult the help dialogue for reminders. Choices - where they are bound by a defined list - are searchable with the up and down arrow keys.

## Global commands

These are commands that can be used throughout the CLI and will work regardless of the menu where they belong.

### Help

The `help` command shows the current menu you are in and all the commands and menus that exist, including a short description for each of these.

This is arguably one of the most helpful commands that the CLI. If you are familiar to navigating in a command line interface, it's the equivalent to `ls -ll`.

### CLS

The `cls` command clears the entire CLI screen.

### Quit

The `quit` command (can also use `q` or `..`) allows to leave the current menu to go one menu above. If the user is on the root, that will mean leaving the CLI.

### Exit

The `exit` command allows the user to exit the CLI.

### Reset

The `reset` command (or `r`) allows a developer that is using the CLI through source code to quickly test it's code changes by re-starting the CLI with the code changes. This allows to improve speed of development.
