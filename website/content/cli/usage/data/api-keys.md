API (Application Programming Interface) keys are access credentials for obtaining data from a particular data vendor. They are a string of random characters assigned, by the data provider, to an individual account.

## Setting API keys

Most vendors offer a free tier requiring only a valid email address, some will require an account with proper KYC (Know Your Customer).

Find all data providers [here](https://docs.openbb.co/platform/extensions/data_extensions), and manage all your credentials directly on the [OpenBB Hub](https://my.openbb.co/app/platform/credentials).
