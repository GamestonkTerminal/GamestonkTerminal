This will open a list of Discord servers where you can add a bot. Select your server and press “Continue”.

Review permissions that the bot requests on your server. Select and deselect based on your needs, we recommend all the default settings in order to experience everything the bot has to offer. Click on “Authorize” when you’re ready.
