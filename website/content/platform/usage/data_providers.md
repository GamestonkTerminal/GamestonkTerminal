When the core OpenBB Platform package is installed, familiar components might be missing.  The extension framework allows individual pieces to be installed and removed seamlessly within the environment.

For example, yFinance.

```console
pip install openbb-yfinance
```

Additions and removals update the router automatically to reflect the changes when the Python interpreter is refreshed.

Search [PyPI](https://pypi.org/search/?q=openbb-) to find more, like `openbb-qa`.
