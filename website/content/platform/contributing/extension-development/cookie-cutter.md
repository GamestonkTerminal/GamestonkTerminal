We have a Cookiecutter template that will help you get started. It serves as a jumpstart for your extensions development, so you can focus on the data and not on the boilerplate.

Please refer to the [Cookiecutter template](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-cookiecutter) and follow the instructions there.

This section will walk you through the steps of adding a new extension to the OpenBB Platform.

The high level steps are:

- Generate the extension structure
- Install your dependencies
- Install your new package
- Use your extension (either from Python or the API interface)
- QA your extension
- Share your extension with the community
