There are many ways to contribute to the OpenBB Platform. You can add a new data point, add a new command, add a new visualization, add a new extension, fix a bug etc.

In this section, we'll be focusing on adding a new data point to the OpenBB Platform.

Before that, we will need to setup our development environment.
