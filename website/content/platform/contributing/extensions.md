Extensions add functionality to the OpenBB Platform. They can be a new data source, a new command, a new visualization, etc.

## Types of extensions

We primarily have 3 types of extensions:

1. OpenBB Extensions - built and maintained by the OpenBB team (e.g. `openbb-stocks`)
2. Community Extensions - built by anyone and primarily maintained by OpenBB (e.g. `openbb-yfinance`)
3. Independent Extensions - built and maintained independently by anyone

If your extension is of high quality and you think that it would be a good community extension, you can open a PR to the OpenBB Platform repository and we'll review it.

We encourage independent extensions to be shared with the community by publishing them to PyPI.
