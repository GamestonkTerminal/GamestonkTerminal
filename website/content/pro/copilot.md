## Getting started

<ReactPlayer width="1156px" height="720px" playing loop muted='true' volume='0' url='https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/assets/14093308/6466c3e3-111b-4246-ae9b-b6403712c862' />

To open OpenBB Copilot, click on the icon located at the bottom right of the Terminal Pro screen.

You can interact with OpenBB Copilot either through typing text or using your
voice.  Under most circumstances, you can treat OpenBB Copilot like your very
own personal research assistant. OpenBB Copilot can answer general financial
questions, use the data displayed in the dashboard to perform analytical tasks,
and even interact with files that you choose to upload.

We'll be exploring each of these features in the sections below.

## Understanding chat history

OpenBB Copilot is a conversational agent. This means that OpenBB Copilot uses
previous messages in the current chat to help answer your query. This means you
can guide OpenBB Copilot to perform the task you want, or ask follow-up
questions.

In the example below, the user first asked about the Price-to-earnings (P/E)
ratio. After OpenBB Copilot was done answering the question, the user asked a
follow-up question regarding additional ratios that may be important. Since
OpenBB Copilot is aware of the chat history of the current conversation (the
topic of conversation is financial ratios), it proceded to answer the user's
query using this context (by suggesting other important financial ratios).


## General question answering
OpenBB Copilot is capable of answering general financial questions and answers.
For example, you can ask Copilot things like "How do I calculate the P/E ratio?"

## Querying the dashboard

## Focus on specific widgets

## Bring your own files


The scope of your request can range from basic commands such as "change theme mode to light", to more intricate requests like "load my equity template with TSLA" or "Add insider trading and ownership widgets to this dashboard".
