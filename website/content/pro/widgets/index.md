## Upper Tab

The upper tab houses all the interactive elements and additional information related to the widget's content.

### Left Side

#### Title

The title identifies the widget and is used when adding the same widget to another dashboard via advanced search.

#### Symbol

Some widgets are associated with a symbol. Changing this symbol updates the table content to reflect the new symbol.

#### Group

The group (if any) that the widget belongs to. If multiple widgets belong to the same group, updating the symbol in one will automatically update the symbol in the others.

### Right Side

#### Staleness Indicator

This indicator shows the freshness of the data:

* Green - updated within the last 30 seconds

* Yellow - updated between 30 seconds and 5 minutes ago

* Red - updated over 5 minutes ago

#### Chat with Widget

Our proprietary generative AI feature allows you to interact with the widget. Ask it to summarize its contents or explain how its data could impact your investment positions.

#### Grouping Mechanism

This feature allows you to group widgets together. When widgets are grouped, they share a color and number. You can see which dashboards have which groupings by looking at the text below the dashboard title in the sidebar.
