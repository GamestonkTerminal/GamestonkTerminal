Welcome to the OpenBB Terminal Pro, your comprehensive tool for investment research. Let's get you started by understanding the layout of the Terminal Pro.

The interface is divided into two main areas:

* **Sidebar**: Here, you'll find your main menu and your dashboards.

  * **Main Menu**: This is your command center, housing the Home, Charting, News, and Data Connectors sections. Each section serves a unique purpose, designed to enhance your research capabilities. Learn more about the Main Menu [here](link to Main Menu).
  * **Dashboards**: This is where all your dashboards (and folders) are organized. To understand more about how dashboards can streamline your workflow, visit [this page](link to Dashboards).

* **Working Area**: This is your research canvas. It's where you'll interact with widgets that provide valuable insights to inform your investment decisions through dashboards, or where you'll access one of the views available from the main menu.

Now that you're familiar with the layout, let's dive into the powerful features of OpenBB Terminal Pro.
