* **Home**: This is your dashboard, where you'll find the latest updates and insights from the OpenBB team.

* **News**: Stay informed with the latest financial news articles, curated and presented for easy consumption. 

* **Charting**: A versatile tool that allows you to visualize and analyze data across various domains - equities, macroeconomics, or cryptocurrencies. Use it for technical analysis or overlay financials for equities to gain deeper insights.

* **Data Connectors**: This feature empowers you to integrate your own data into Terminal Pro. Leverage this alongside the vast financial data accessible from Terminal Pro to make informed decisions.
