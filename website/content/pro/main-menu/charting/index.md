## Overlay Financials

When analyzing equity data, you'll notice the "Financial" text above the chart. This powerful tool allows you to overlay financial data (e.g., revenue, cost of goods, etc.) over time, providing a visual representation of how financials impact the equity price trajectory. It's a powerful way to understand the correlation between a company's financial performance and its stock price.
