A report can be created out of a dashboard so that you have a static report of the interactive dashboard. This report can be a PDF or PNG format. This can be very powerful to record a moment in time, particularly when adding the text widget with additional insights from a user.

You can export a dashboard as a report through the bottom right plus icon on the working area or through the dashboard's settings on the sidebar.
