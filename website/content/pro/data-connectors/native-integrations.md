## Using OpenBB Native Integrations

The OpenBB native integrations allows you to connect to Snowflake, MySQL, or SQLite databases directly. You can run any query against your database directly from our terminal.

1. **Install our Client**: Reach out to us [here](mailto:colin.delahunty@openbb.finance?subject=Data%20Connector) to receive your free client.

2. **Run the Client**: Simply click on our app and type in the port you would like to use. If you are unsure of a good port, feel free to select `Recommend Port`.

3. **Connect inside the Terminal Pro**: Once your client is up and running, click [here](https://pro.openbb.co/app/data-connectors) to enable the connectors. Now feel free to enter login credentials for any Snowflake, MySQL, or SQLite database and begin to analyze your data inside of our terminal.
