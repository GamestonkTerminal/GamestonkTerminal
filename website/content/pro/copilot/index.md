To initiate a dialogue with the OpenBB Copilot, simply click on the icon located at the top left of your screen. You have the option to input your request either through typing or voice command.

The scope of your request can range from basic commands such as "change theme mode to light", to more intricate requests like "load my equity template with TSLA" or "Add insider trading and ownership widgets to this dashboard".
