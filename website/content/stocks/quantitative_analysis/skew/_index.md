usage: skew [-l N_LENGTH] [-h] [--export {csv,json,xlsx}]
```

Skewness is a measure of asymmetry or distortion of symmetric distribution. It measures the deviation of the given
distribution of a random variable from a symmetric distribution, such as normal distribution. A normal distribution is
without any skewness, as it is symmetrical on both sides. Hence, a curve is regarded as skewed if it is shifted
towards the right or the left.
