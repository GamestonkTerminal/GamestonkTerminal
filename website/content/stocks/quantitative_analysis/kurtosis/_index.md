usage: kurtosis [-l N_LENGTH] [-h] [--export {csv,json,xlsx}]
```

Kurtosis is a measure of the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. Like
skewness, kurtosis describes the shape of a probability distribution and there are different ways of quantifying it
for a theoretical distribution and corresponding ways of estimating it from a sample from a population. Different
measures of kurtosis may have different interpretations.
