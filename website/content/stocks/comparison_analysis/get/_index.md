```text
get [-s {polygon,finnhub,finviz}] [--nocountry]
```

Get similar companies to compare with. [Source: Finviz by default]

* -s : source that provides similar companies. Default: polygon.
* --nocountry : when getting similar companies from Finviz, we filter by same Industry, Sector and Country. However, if we don't want to filter by same country we can set this flag. For this flag to work, the `-p` flag can't be selected.
